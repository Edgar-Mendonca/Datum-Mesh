## 0.1.1 — 2026-10-28

Frames and trusses solve: press Solve (F5) and see the deflected shape, the moment, shear and axial diagrams, the reactions and the equilibrium check.

**Solving**
- 2D beam elements (axial force, shear and bending) and truss bars (axial force only), solved with a sparse solver in a few milliseconds.
- Point forces and moments at nodes, uniform and linearly varying loads on members (along x, along y or across the member), and self-weight from each material's density.
- Fixed, pinned, roller and spring supports.
- A model that can move without resistance (a missing support, a truss without triangles) says so instead of giving numbers.

**Results**
- The deflected shape, drawn larger by a round factor you can change with a slider.
- Bending moment (drawn on the tension side), shear force and axial force diagrams, with the values at the ends and the peaks.
- Reactions as arrows with their values.
- Utilisation colours: below 50 %, 50 to 100 %, and over 100 % of the yield strength.
- A probe: hover a member to read N, V, M and the deflection at that point.
- **The equilibrium check**: the reactions are added up and compared with the loads after every solve, on screen and in the report.
- View › Results: reactions, every member's largest forces, deflection, stress and utilisation, and the solver report.
- After an edit, the results stay on screen but are marked out of date until you solve again.

**Trust**
- **Help › Verification** solves the benchmarks in front of you and compares them with the known answers: a cantilever (tip deflection, rotation and root moment), a simply supported beam under a uniform load, and two trusses worked by hand. All 12 checks agree to better than one part in a billion. The same checks run as tests before every release; the record is in [docs/verification/0.1.1.md](docs/verification/0.1.1.md).

**Printing**: the report page adds the equilibrium check, the reactions and the member results when the model is solved.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-28

The first version: the Datum Mesh window, the drawing canvas, and models that save and open. Solving arrives in the next releases: frames and trusses in 0.1.1, parts in 0.1.2.

**Frames and trusses**
- Draw beams and truss bars on a grid: click two points for each member; a node is made at each end, or an existing node is used.
- Nodes at typed coordinates; move anything by dragging or with the arrow keys, always landing on the grid.
- Sections: rectangle, round bar, tube, box, I, channel, angle, or your own values; the area, second moment of area and extreme fibre distance are worked out for you.

**Parts**
- Rectangles, circles and polygons, with edges that can be arcs (fillets and rounded ends), and holes cut out of them.
- Plane stress (with a thickness), plane strain and heat conduction.

**Supports and loads**
- Fixed, pinned, roller, spring and symmetry supports on nodes, edges and points.
- Forces, moments, uniform and linearly varying member loads, pressure and forces on edges, gravity.
- Heat: fixed temperatures, heat flux, convection and heat generation.
- Every value in SI (mm, kN, MPa, °C) or US (in, kip, ksi, °F) units; files keep SI, so switching never rounds anything.

**Worked examples**: a portal frame with wind and roof loads, a roof truss, a lifting lug, an L-bracket with a fillet, a flange plate with bolt holes, and a heat sink.

**And** the Datum family window: ribbon, File page, options, print to PDF with a title block, a ? card beside every tool, Tell Me (Ctrl+K), light and dark themes, recovery of unsaved work, and updates from inside the app. Damaged model files open as far as possible and say what was left out.
